To whom it may concern at the AP

This letter is written to point out a factual error commonly made in AP articles and other journalism, and to ask the AP to publish a style recommendation to encourage AP journalists and other journalists to avoid it in the future.

I have noticed a disturbing trend of news articles and media incorrectly reporting on 3rd party politicians at the federal, state, and local level.  In specific, elected officials who are explicitly affiliated to the Green and Libertarian parties are often repeatedly incorrectly referred to as being non-party affiliated or "independent".  However, election regulations at the State and Federal level have specific meaning to being "independent" or NPA which precludes being registered to same thing as being registered to a specific 3rd party. 

I have collected dozens of instances of this factual error here:  
In addition to the problem of being simply factually incorrect (which should be enough on it's own to bother to correct it), errors of this nature in reporting have a harmful impact on the american electorate and political system:  When candidates are falsely reported as being Independent or their party is otherwise misrepresented, voters can get them confused for other candidates at the ballot box.  Voters who intend to vote for "That independent guy who voted for prison reform" might mark their ballot for the wrong candidate based on seeing an (I) or NPA on their ballot, when the candidate they intended to vote for might be listed as (L) or (G).  It also prevents the leadership from 3rd parties from taking responsibility for their failures OR successes in candidates,and voters have a right to know when candidates serve party leadership and what platforms they are attached to.  

Journalism serves an important function in our democracy to ensure that voters have accurate information, and the AP is uniquely positioned to establish standardstowards that end to rectify these sorts of issues. Although many of the instances are broadcast institutions and publications not directly affiliated with the AP, publishing a notice about this issue in AP style guidelines would make other journalists take notice and take more care.  A simple memo about "Accuracy in reporting Party Affiliation" would be sufficient to correct this widespread factual error.

Thank you
